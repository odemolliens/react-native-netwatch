- Log network requests coming from React Native side
- Log network requests coming from the native side (iOS and Android) (optional)
- Log Redux actions (optional)
- Shake the device to display the tool
- View details of each request/action
- Generate and share the list of requests/actions in Excel (XLSX) file
- Log connectivity change
- Show stats between success/warning/failure requests

## Getting started

### Dependencies

To avoid to have too much dependencies and conflict versions, before install, you must have these dependancies in your react-native project.

- react-native-paper
- react-native-fs
- react-native-share
- @react-native-community/netinfo

#### Fonts

Netwatch has react-native-vector-icons as dependency. Be sure that you have these fonts installed in your project:

- Fontisto
- Feather
- MaterialCommunityIcons

Please refer to this page for more details: <a href='https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#ios'>Install fonts react-native-vector-icons</a>

### Installation

```bash
yarn add react-native-netwatch
```

or

```bash
npm install react-native-netwatch
```

### iOS

Inside your project, go to ios directory and execute pod install

```bash
cd ios && pod install && ..
```

OR simply

```bash
npx pod-install
```

## Usage

### Using Netwatch component

If you want add Network traffic in your project, just import 'react-native-netwatch'</br>
and add the Netwatch component in the most higher position in the tree of components.</br>
For example, just after your store provider or your root component

Now, when you will launch your application and shake the device, it will display automatically Netwatch.

### How to activate Netwatch

You have two possibilities to activate Netwatch in your project. With a button from you app or by shaking your phone. If you want activate
Netwatch with a button from your app, you **must** disable shake and instead pass the props onPressClose and visible.

#### Active Netwatch by shaking your phone

```javascript
{...}

import { Netwatch } from 'react-native-netwatch';

const App = () => {
  const [netwatchVisible, setNetwatchVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Netwatch
        enabled={true}
        interceptIOS={true}
      />
      <AppNavigator />
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Active Netwatch with a button

```javascript
{...}

import { Netwatch } from 'react-native-netwatch';

const App = () => {
  const [netwatchVisible, setNetwatchVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Netwatch
        enabled={true}
        interceptIOS={true}
        visible={netwatchVisible}
        onPressClose={() => setNetwatchVisible(false)}
        disableShake
      />
        <TouchableHighlight
          style={styles.openButton}
          onPress={() => setNetwatchVisible(true)}
          testID="buttonDisplayNetwatch"
        >
          <Text style={styles.textStyle}>Display Netwatch</Text>
        </TouchableHighlight>
      <AppNavigator />
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Using Netwatch as Redux middleware (optional)

You can add 'react-native-netwatch' as a middleware to catch Redux actions</br>
To do that, just import reduxLogger from 'react-native-netwatch'</br>

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, combineReducers, compose, createStore } from 'redux';
import appActionsReducer from './reducers/appActionsReducer';
import { reduxLogger } from 'react-native-netwatch';

const createReducer = () => (state, action) =>
  combineReducers({
    app: appActionsReducer,
  })(state, action);

const store = createStore(
  createReducer(),
  compose(applyMiddleware(reduxLogger)actionLog.enhancer),
);

export default store;

```

Example in our demo application [here](https://github.com/odemolliens/react-native-netwatch/blob/5b6d19f40d7dc98cedb665172503fed93a8b0ae8/example/src/redux/store.ts#L23)

### Using Netwatch to intercept and display native requests

#### Android (optional)

To be able to intercept requests from Android side and display them into Netwatch</br>
You have to add to your OkHttp client Netwatch interceptor

```java
okHttpClient.addInterceptor(new NetwatchInterceptor(context));
```

Example in our demo application [here](https://github.com/odemolliens/react-native-netwatch/blob/5b6d19f40d7dc98cedb665172503fed93a8b0ae8/example/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/ExampleModule.java#L24)

#### iOS (optional)

Nothing to do on native side for the iOS.</br>
You have just to set `interceptIOS` to true and it will intercept requests which use `URLProtocol` on native side and display them into Netwatch</br>

- To intercept request sent with Alamofire

```objective-c
'Bridging-Header.h'

#import <NetwatchInterceptor.h>
```

```swift
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.protocolClasses?.insert(NetwatchInterceptor.self, at: 0)
let sessionManager = Alamofire.SessionManager(configuration: configuration)
sessionManager.request(...)
```

### Show stats

You can have statistics and see how many requests are succeeded or failed. By default, the indicator is closed. If you want the percentage, just press the indactor to opened it. Press again to close.

  <img src="assets/stats.png" width="300" />
  <img src="assets/stats_opened.png" width="300" />
</p>

If you have applied a filter, stats are updated for current filtered view. If you have filtered to see Redux Action, the indicator is not interactive and just show a purple indicator.

### Add extra informations into Redux Action items (optional)

If you want, you can add extra datas in the redux items to have more visual information. Instead of just see 'redux action' as label, your own text will be displayed.
To do that, you must passed to Netwatch a props called reduxConfig. This is an object where each key correspond to a redux action in your project.
All values **must** be string.

```javascript
{...}

import { Netwatch } from 'react-native-netwatch';

const reduxConfigExample = {
  DOWNLOAD_APP_TRANSLATIONS_SUCCESS: "üë® - Extra info",
}

const App = () => {
  const [netwatchVisible, setNetwatchVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Netwatch
        enabled={true}
        interceptIOS={true}
        reduxConfig={reduxConfigExample}
      />
      <AppNavigator />
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

You will see something like that:

</p>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Using Netwatch with Reactotron

There is a known incompatibility between Netwatch and Reactotron. If you want to redirect the requests into Reactotron, you should set the props useReactotron = true. After that, don't forget to reload your app. To go back to netwatch revert the props to false and reload again.

At this moment, it is not possible to display requests into Netwatch and Reactotron at the same time. You **must** chosse between these tools.
